#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The files that will need to be edited or added to satisfy the request are:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the exported `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new file that describes the logo image to be generated.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

I need to create a new file for the logo description.  
Please add the following file to the chat:

```
mini-app/public/logo.png.todo
```

Once that file is added, I can provide the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for updating `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` and creating the logo description.

A stylized token icon featuring a circular coin with a subtle gradient background. The coin displays a faint, upward‑trending line chart overlay, symbolizing token vesting and unlock schedules. The chart line is green, indicating growth, and the coin’s edge has a subtle metallic sheen to convey value and security. The overall composition is clean and modern, suitable for a crypto‑focused application logo.
